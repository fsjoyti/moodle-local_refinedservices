Connect-2-Moodle
================

The world's most flexible, live virtual classroom solution (Adobe® Connect™) meets the world's most popular LMS (Moodle®) in a seamless integration from Refined Data Solutions!

With the Connect-2-Moodle plugin, users can enter Adobe Connect meetings, launch Presenter and Captivate presentations and watch event recordings with a single click from inside of Moodle.

Connect-2-Moodle provides a Single Sign On (SSO) environment in which information passes effortlessly in both directions between the two platforms so users cannot tell where Moodle ends and Adobe Connect begins.
